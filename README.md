# libsodium-android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/beemdevelopment/libsodium-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/beemdevelopment/libsodium-android)

__libsodium-android__ is the library used in [Aegis
Authenticator](https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis) for JNI bindings to
[libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium). It only binds a minimal set
of functions and is not meant to be used by other projects.
